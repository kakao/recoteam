              This dataset contains 148,826 playlists composed of 649,091 unique
              songs and mel-spectrogram data for each song. The included
              playlists are the listed item in the Melon DJ Playlist service
              provided by Melon. In addition, Melon DJ Playlist consists of
              playlists both made by experts contracting with us in advance for
              quality assurance and filtered by the company’s quality standard
              among those submitted by Melon users who want to put on the Melon

              For setting contest questions, we will provide the entire playlist
              data separately as <code>train.json</code> composed of 115,071
              playlists, <code>val.json</code> composed of 23,015 playlists, and
              <code>test.json</code> composed of 10,740 playlists. Unlike
              <code>train.json</code>, <code>test.json</code> and
              <code>train.json</code> have some of the songs and tags in their
              playlists masked for the submission of answers.

              Mel-spectrogram data are saved as a ‘<code>{songID}.npy</code>’
              file name with the file extension npy. A number from 0 to 707988
              is assigned as song ID, and each file is allocated to and stored
              in the <code>{floor(ID / 1000)}/</code> directory. For example,
              the song with ID 415263 is saved as 415/415263.npy. The
              2.1b.dev677 version of Essentia library was used to extract each
              mel-spectrogram. mel-spectrogram was calculated in the use of
              segments of a song’s 20~50 second-interval to reduce the 16Khz
              sample size rate, 512 frame size, 256 hop size, Hann window
              function, and data size and employed 48 mel-bands resolution so
              that Melon Playlist Dataset can contain about 240GB data.
